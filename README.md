### 📌 Notable Projects

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Red Team Simulation](https://github.com/aashraymt/Red-Teaming-Simulation) | Built and operated a full red team lab simulating enterprise environments; conducted external enumeration, network/web exploitation, and internal AD attacks including Kerberoasting, DCSync, and Golden Ticket. Mapped attack phases to the MITRE ATT&CK framework; practiced network pivoting, firewall evasion, and LOLBAS techniques for stealth and lateral movement. |
| [☁️ SIEM Log Analysis Threat Detection Lab](https://github.com/aashraymt/SIEM-Log-Analysis-Threat-Detection-Lab) | Streamed AWS, Azure, and GCP logs into a personal ELK stack for blue team analysis. |
| [🕵️‍♂️ Keylogger PoC](https://github.com/aashraymt/Keylogger) | Basic keylogger built in Python with efficient file writing and listener management. |
| [🎯 CTF Writeups](https://aashraymt.medium.com/) | Walkthroughs and PoCs from Hack The Box and PicoCTF challenges. |
| [👥 Active Directory Home Lab: User Creation](https://github.com/aashraymt/AD-Lab/tree/main/) | Set up a Windows Server domain controller and automated the creation of 1000+ users with custom OU structures using PowerShell scripts for red team simulation and access control testing. |
| [🛡️SIEM with Microsoft Sentinel on Azure](https://github.com/aashraymt/Azure-Sentinel-SIEM-Home-Lab) | A cloud-based home lab demonstrating end-to-end security operations by using Azure Sentinel to detect and visualize real-time brute-force attacks on a vulnerable Windows virtual machine. |
